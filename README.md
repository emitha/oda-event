Oracle Digital Assistant: HR Template Training ----- creating bots by Business Users

Before you Begin

This is hands-on lab in an entry-level exercise to start working with Oracle Digital Assistant using the Concierge template

Background

Oracle Digital Assistant is an environment for building digital assistants, which are user interfaces driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that help users accomplish a variety of tasks in natural language conversations. Digital assistants consist of one or more skills, which are individual chatbots that are focused on specific types of tasks.

In this lab, you will create a Q&A bot based on the concierge template. This bot will be able to:

• Welcome the user whenever the bot is started

• Answer specific questions directly

• Show different options when the question has not been clearly specified by the user

• Collect feedback from the user to understand if the bot is working fine
